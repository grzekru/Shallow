# An example tagset that allows to use Morfeusz lexical analyzer

# The encoding of this file should be ASCII

# This example is not an exact tagset of Morfeusz, rather it's superset!

# Comments can start in any position of line beginning from #
# Empty lines are ignored

[ATTR]

# First section - attributes and their values
# Names and values of enumerable attributes and part-of-speeches must be
# single words containing letters and underscores.
# They are case-sensitive. Must not be single capital letter 
# and any of the rules syntax keywords.
# Number of values of a single attribute should not exceed 
# 'maxNumberOfValues' defined in configuration.

# and optional number_of_partitions is an integer.
# The default value of number_of_partitions is 1. 
# All the numeric values of the attribute will be stored rounded to
# a multiple of precision=(upper_bound-lower_bound)/(number_of_partitions-1).
